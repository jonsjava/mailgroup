REQUIREMENTS:
MySQL5(maybe 4, but I coded on 5)
PHP5(same as above)
Web Server able to serve out PHP files
basic knowledge of modifying a config file



You can contact the developer by emailing: webmaster@jonsjava.com
or visit http://jonsjava.com




INSTALLATION
The configuration is pretty straightforward:
Step 1: create a MySQL database
Step 2: modify config.inc.php
	change $host to the host of your mysql server (usually won't need to change, though)
	change $db to reflect the database you just created
	change $db_user to the database user that has rights to that database.
	change $db_password to the afore mentioned database users password
	change the $web_addr to the address of your site (not the folder, that comes later, and no trailing slash),
	change the $server_root to the path (web root) of your install. if your install is http://example.com/mailer/,
		web root is /mailer/ (I know, I said server root, but I had a typo, and didn't wanna go through
		changing all the scripts to reflect the true phrase)
	change $list_name to whatever you want to name this install. This is how the database distinguishes all the data
		from one install to the next (if you use the same database for multiple installs) Don't leave this field blank
Step 3: open the installer in a web browser (http://example.com/<installed folder>/installer)
	follow the instructions
	REMOVE THE INSTALLER FOLDER AFTER YOU ARE COMPLETE!
Step 4: Create some users, moderators, and supervisors.
Step 5: Test it out before going live




NOTES:
The system has a "shutdown system" feature. If you run that script, nobody will be able to log into the user portion,
but you will still be able to log into the admin portion. When you are installing, I reccomend you use a different system
password from your admin password, and keep it secret. 

You will need to create your own terms of service after installing, because I'm no lawyer, and I don't wanna write
like a lawyer.

Updates will come as I get the time. If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to contact me, and I will
look at your work. This project took about a week to write, and another week to fine-tune. If you can do better, by all means,
show me!  I have a major headache after all this.

Time to get a beer.
